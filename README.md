# Infotainment-System-Testing
This project involves code and scripts for testing the functionality and performance of an automotive infotainment system. Testing is done via SRS analysis, transforming requirements into test cases. Utilizes SIQ for better requirement understanding. Strategy includes test objectives, quality goals, techniques, environment setup, defect management, and metrics for user-centric system assurance.

## Test Cases
The test cases are designed and planned according to the software requirements specification (SRS) and the best practices for infotainment testing[^1^][2]. The test cases cover the following aspects of the infotainment system:

- UI Testing: To verify the usability, functionality, and consistency of the user interface
- System Security: To check the security features and vulnerabilities of the system
- Connectivity Testing: To test the connectivity and compatibility of the system with various devices and networks
- Performance Testing: To measure the speed, reliability, and stability of the system under different conditions

## Test Results
The test results are stored `Documentation` folder of the repo. The results include the following information:

- Test case name and description
- Test execution status (pass/fail)
- Test execution logs
- Test execution reports
- Peer Reviews and iterations
